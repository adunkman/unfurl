# Unfurl.page

> üöß This project is still in active development and should not be considered stable.

API (and accompanying documentation) for social media-style expansion of links with site-defined metadata.

## Getting started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This documentation is for getting started as a contributor. If you‚Äôre looking for information on using the API, head to [unfurl.page](https://unfurl.page/).

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) version 1.10.0+ (required)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10.0.0+ (recommended) ‚Äî enables linting, `git` hooks, and better editor integration.

### Install application dependencies

The majority of dependencies are installed within docker containers, so we recommend always running the application inside of their containers.

To prepare for local development by installing all dependencies, building docker containers, and creating local databases run:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

### Starting the application

Start the application‚Äôs docker containers with:

```bash
make start
```

- The documentation pages are available at [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).
- The API is available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Use <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to shutdown the application.

#### Testing authentication locally

To test endpoints that require key authentication, use API key `test-consumer-token`.

For GitHub authentication, [configure a test OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and add the credentials to a new file called `.env` to be loaded automatically. If you‚Äôd like your key to be authorized as an administrator, add your GitHub email to `ADMIN_EMAILS_CSV` as well.

- Homepage URL: http://0.0.0.0:3000
- Application callback URL: http://0.0.0.0:3000/sessions/new

```
AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
ADMIN_EMAILS_CSV=
```

Restart the server if running.

### Additional development commands

See all available development commands by running:

```
make
```

### Editor configuration

We recommend integrating the following with your editor:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to apply consistent code formatting rules. These rules are enforced on commit, so editor integration significantly reduces frustration.

## Managing secrets

Secrets needed beyond AWS credentials are encrypted in this repository using [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops). To edit the encrypted files in `terraform/variables.enc.yml`:

```bash
make secrets-edit
```

Your AWS credentials must be accessible in the environment, and they must be able to access the encryption key in AWS KMS.
